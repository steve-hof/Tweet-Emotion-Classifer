# Models for the Multi-label Emotion Classification of Tweets

### While much has been accomplished, this is still very much a work in progress
### This README will be greatly expanded upon in the future

The purpose of this project was to build machine learning models that could properly classify the emotions present in tweets. In doing so, it was to serve as a learning space for natural language processing, as well as both the theory behind and python implementation of algorithmic classifiers. The classification problem was of an eleven way multi-label structure and proved to be a difficult but rewarding first project in Machine Learning. 

Most of the files listed are inconsequential and will be cleaned in time. The files of any consequence are (The paper referred to will be posted soon):

1. preprocess_tf_binary.py
When I initially built the first neural network, the code I wrote took eons to execute. For that reason I included it in another file (this one). While the code now takes next to no time, Iâ€™ve left it in this separate file. This file pre-processes the data to feed into tf_binary_clf.py

2. tf_binary_clf.py
This file runs the tensor flow binary classification (GloVe embeddings) algorithm discussed  in the paper (BCLSTM)

3. skl_binary_clf.py
This file contains all the code for executing the binary classification per emotion for all of the Bag of Words models discussed in the paper.

4. skl_multi_label_BoW_clf.py
This file contains all the code for executing the multi-label classification of the Bag of Words models discussed in the paper

5. keras_multi_label_glove.py
This file contains all of the code for executing the GloVe embedding multi-label classification networks discussed in the paper (ie keras-LSTM, Feed Forward Neural Network, etc)
